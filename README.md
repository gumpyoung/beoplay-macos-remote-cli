## Configuration
The command line utility is using [Bonjour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_(software)) to discover available speakers on the local network and automatically connects to the first one found.

This default behaviour can be overriden:
```
$ defaults write beoplay-cli host Beoplay-M5-28096178.local.
```
