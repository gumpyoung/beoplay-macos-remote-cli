# beoplay-cli

This is an unofficial Command Line Interface for macOS to remote control network enabled Beoplay loudspeakers.

The CLI is built on top of the [RemoteCore](https://github.com/tlk/beoplay-macos-remote-cli/tree/master/Sources/RemoteCore) library which is also used by the [Beoplay Remote](https://github.com/tlk/beoplay-macos-remote-gui) menu bar app for macOS.

## Installation

$ beoplay-cli emulator 80 "Funkytown"

$
```

## Configuration
The command line utility is using [Bonjour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_(software)) to discover available speakers on the local network and automatically connects to the first one found.

This default behaviour can be changed by setting up defaults:
```
$ beoplay-cli discover
name: Beoplay M5 i k√∏kkenet
host: Beoplay-M5-28096178.local.
port: 8080
$ defaults write beoplay-cli host Beoplay-M5-28096178.local.
```

It can also be changed by using environment variables:
```
$ BEOPLAY_HOST=macbook12.local. BEOPLAY_PORT=8080 beoplay-cli getSources
```
